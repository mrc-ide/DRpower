</h3>
<p>The majority of malaria diagnosis worldwide relies on rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs). A large proportion of these tests work by
detecting the presence of the HPR2 protein in the blood of an infected
individual, which reacts to give a positive result. However,
<em>Plasmodium</em> parasites have been found in many countries that
carry a deletion of the <em>pfhrp2</em> gene. Without this gene the
parasites do not express the HPR2 protein, rendering them invisible to
testing by HRP2-based RDTs. This presents a major clinical problem if
these gene deletions rise to high frequencies in the population, as
patients presenting with symptoms of malaria may be misdiagnosed,
resulting in treatment delays or missed cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it">What are we doing about it?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-we-doing-about-it"></a>
</h3>
<p>Many ongoing malaria molecular surveillance (MMS) efforts are trying
to establish where <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions are in the world, where
they have already reached high frequencies, and how patterns are
changing in space and time. The spread of <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions is
recognised as a global threat to malaria control by the World Health
Organization (WHO). The <a href="https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/" class="external-link">WHO malaria threats
map</a> contains a page on <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions where one can
browse current patterns or download raw data.</p>
<p>The WHO have also periodically released guidance on how to run a
study looking for <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions and how to respond
appropriately given the results. One such document that is highly
relevant here is the <a href="https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/331197" class="external-link">Master protocol for
surveillance of <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions and biobanking to support
future research</a>, published in 2020. This document gives guidance on
a wide range of issues related to <em>pfhrp2/3</em> studies, including
data collection and fieldwork, data storage and laboratory analysis, and
providing templates such as informed consent forms for participants.</p>

</h3>
<p>The recommended approach in the 2020 Master Protocol begins with
estimating the prevalence of deletions and constructing a 95% confidence
interval (CI) around this estimate. There are three possible
outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outcome 1: The upper limit of the 95% CI is below the 5% threshold
(<em>conclusion = low prevalence</em>).</li>
<li>Outcome 2: The lower limit of the 95% CI is above the 5% threshold
(<em>conclusion = high prevalence</em>).</li>
<li>Outcome 3: The 95% CI spans the 5% threshold
(<em>inconclusive</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of these three outcomes are shown in the plot below:</p>
<p><img src="rationale1_background_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="480"></p>
<p>If outcome 2 is found in any domain within a country then the country
as a whole is recommended to switch RDTs to a brand that does not rely
exclusively on the HRP2 protein. If outcomes 1 or 3 are detected in all
domains then some form of periodic monitoring is still advised, but the
urgency is lower.</p>

</h3>
<p>Publication of the Master Protocol was a major step forward in
specifying what a well designed <em>pfhrp2/3</em> study might look like.
However, there were also some issues around power and sample size
calculations in this document. Some of these issues were corrected in a
later <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/malaria/diagnosis/9789240002050-corrigenda.pdf?sfvrsn=d67857_3" class="external-link">corrigenda
to the original protocol</a>, but other statistical issues remain
(described in detail later).</p>
<p>The <em>DRpower</em> tool was developed to take a fresh approach to
power and sample size calculation for <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletion
studies, thereby solving some of the issues left by the 2020 Master
Protocol. In some aspects we tried to align closely with the original
study design - for example assuming a multi-centre study that attempts
to draw inference about the prevalence of <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions at
a higher geographic level than any single health facility. We also use
the same “threshold analysis” approach, in which we want to determine if
the prevalence of deletions is above 5%. But in other ways we redesigned
the statistics from the bottom up. For example, we took a Bayesian
statistical approach, and also changed the way we think about
intra-cluster correlation. The hypothesis that we are testing is also
subtly different from that presented in the 2020 Master protocol.</p>
<p>Finally, one of our objectives in developing <em>DRpower</em> was to
provide greater flexibility at the design stage, while also making the
process as simple as possible. This motivated the development of the <a href="https://shiny.dide.ic.ac.uk/DRpower-app/" class="external-link">pfhrp2/3 Planner</a>,
which runs the <em>DRpower</em> model in a simple web-based
interface.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="defining-our-terms">Defining our terms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-our-terms"></a>
</h3>
<p>The next pages go into detail about the issues with the original 2020
Master Protocol, the rationale behind the <em>DRpower</em> Bayesian
model, how we estimate power under this model, and what we obtain in
terms of minimum sample sizes. However, before jumping into this we
should define some terminology.</p>
<p>First, we assume that the study is run at multiple distinct
locations, not just a single location. There are many possible terms
used for these locations, for example centre, site, cluster, or health
facility. We opt for the name <em>site</em>, as it is general enough to
allow for different types of facility while also not being a purely
statistical term like “cluster”. However, we may occasionally move
between terms, for example we refer frequently to the “intra-cluster
correlation coefficient”.</p>
<p>We assume that our intention is to pool results over sites in order
to estimate the prevalence at a higher geographic level. We refer to
this higher geographic level as a <em>domain</em>. This term was chosen
to be deliberately vague. The actual meaning of a “domain” may vary from
one study to the next, and one country to the next. For example, it may
be a “region” in one country, a “province” in the next, or an “ADMIN1
unit” in another. We do not talk explicitly about the ways that choice
of domain may impact a study, although it almost certainly will,
particularly with reference to the level of intra-cluster
correlation.</p>
<p>Finally, we refer to <em>pfhrp2/3</em> deletions to capture the fact
that researchers may be interested in either the <em>pfhrp2</em> or
<em>pfhrp3</em> locus. The <em>pfhrp3</em> gene expresses the HRP3
protein, which is structurally similar enough to HRP2 that it
occasionally recovers the ability of the test to detect malaria.
Therefore, if you are infected with a parasite strain that has the gene
deletion for <em>pfhrp2</em> but not the gene deletion for
<em>pfhrp3</em> then you <em>may</em> still be positive by HRP2-based
RDT, although the probability of detection is lower. However,
<em>DRpower</em> does not explicitly account for joint analysis of
multiple loci and so we assume you are powering for just one set of
deletion counts.</p>
