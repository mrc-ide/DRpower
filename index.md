The DRpower package is designed to assist with the development of *Plasmodium falciparum* *pfhrp2/3* gene deletion studies. It can be used in the following ways:

- **In the design phase** to choose a number of clusters and a sample size per cluster to achieve a desired level of power. This is a critical step that ensures the conclusions of a study are statistically valid
- **In the analysis phase** to perform calculations to estimate the prevalence of *pfhrp2/3* deletions and to test whether this is over a set threshold (5% by default)

The simplest way to interact with the package is through the [interactive web app](TODO), which contains all the main functions of the package in a user-friendly environment. If you are looking for a simple way to design a study or analyse your data then we suggest you start with the app.

The [documentation](articles/rationale1_background.html) on this website is inteded for people who want to gain a deeper understanding of how the method works, and its strengths and weaknesses relative to other approaches.

For those wanting to jump straight into using the software, see the [installation instructions here](articles/installation.html) followed by a series of [tutorials](articles/tutorial_design.html) on how to perform various analyses.
