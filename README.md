# DRpower

This package is designed to simplify the process of designing Plasmodium hrp2/3
gene deletion studies, including performing sample size and power calculations
before collecting any samples, and analysing data once it arrives. The current version of the package is fairly simple, and contains only the following functions:
  * foo
  # bar
