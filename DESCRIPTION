Title: Sample size estimation and power analysis for drug- and diagnostic
    resistance studies
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Can be used to analyse prevalence data typical of drug- and
    diagnostic-resistance studies (i.e. pfhrp2/3 deletions in malaria). Uses a
    Bayesian approach to estimate both the prevalence and the level of intra-
    cluster correlation. Also estimates the power via simulation for a given
    sample size, making it possible to choose a sample size to achieve a given
    desired power.
