Description: This package can be used in the design and/or analysis stages of
    Plasmodium falciparum pfhrp2/3 deletion prevalence studies. It assumes that
    the study takes the form of a clustered prevalence survey, meaning the data
    consists of a numerator (number tested) and denominator (number of deletions
    found) over multiple clusters. Further, it assumes that we are interested in
    estimating the study-level prevalence, i.e. over all clusters, while
    accounting for the possibility of high intra-cluster correlation. It does
    this using a Bayesian random effects model. When designing a study, rather
    than analysing data, power can be estimated empirically by simulation. This
    can be used to establish a minimum sample size required to achieve a given
    target power.
