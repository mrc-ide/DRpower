Description: This package can be used in the design and/or analysis stages of
    Plasmodium falciparum pfhrp2/3 deletion prevalence studies. We assume that
    the study takes the form of a clustered prevalence survey, meaning the data
    consists of a numerator (number of deletions found) and denominator (number
    tested) over multiple clusters. We are interested in estimating the
    study-level prevalence, i.e. over all clusters, while accounting for the
    possibility of high intra-cluster correlation. The analysis approach uses a
    Bayesian random effects model to estimate prevalence and intra-cluster
    correlation. The approach to power analysis is simulation-based, running the
    analysis many times on simulated data and estimating empirical power. This
    method can be used to establish a minimum sample size required to achieve a
    given target power.
