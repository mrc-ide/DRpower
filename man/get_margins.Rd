\arguments{
\item{N}{the number of samples obtained from each cluster, assumed the same
over all clusters.}

\item{n_clust}{the number of clusters.}

\item{prevalence}{the true prevalence of the marker in the population as a
proportion between 0 and 1.}

\item{ICC}{assumed true intra-cluster correlation (ICC) between 0 and 1.}

\item{alpha}{the significance level of the CI.}

\item{MOE}{the target margin of error.}

\item{N_max}{the largest value of \eqn{N} to consider.}
}
\value{
the functions \code{get_margin()} and \code{get_margin_CP()} return
  the expected lower and upper CI limits on the prevalence as a value between
  0 and 1 (i.e. not as a percentage). Technically this is not the MOE, as
  that would be the difference between these limits and the assumed
  prevalence. However, we feel this is a more useful and more intuitive
  output.

\description{
Calculate the expected margin of error when estimating
  prevalence from a clustered survey, or calculate the sample size required
  to achieve a given target margin of error.

\details{
A very common approach when constructing confidence intervals (CIs)
  from prevalence data is to use the Wald interval:
  
  \deqn{\hat{p} \pm z\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{N}}}
  
  where \eqn{\hat{p}} is our estimate of the prevalence, \eqn{z} is the
  critical value of the normal distribution (\eqn{z=1.96} for a 95\%
  interval) and \eqn{N} is the sample size. When estimating prevalence from a
  clustered survey, we need to modify this formula as follows:
  
  \deqn{\hat{p} \pm z\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{Nc}(1 + (n - 1) r)}}
  
  where \eqn{\hat{p}} is the \emph{mean} prevalence over clusters, \eqn{c} is
  the number of clusters, and \eqn{r} is the intra-cluster correlation (ICC,
  a value between 0 and 1). The term to the right of the \eqn{\pm} symbol is
  called the \emph{margin of error} (MOE). We can give this term the name
  \eqn{d}. The function \code{get_margin()} returns the values
  \eqn{\hat{p}-d} and \eqn{\hat{p}+d}, i.e. the lower and upper estimates of
  what our CI will be.
  
  We can also rearrange this formula to get the sample size (\eqn{N})
  required to achieve any given MOE:
  
  \deqn{ N = \frac{ z^2p(1-p)(1-r) }{ cd^2 - z^2p(1-p)r } }
  
  The function \code{get_sample_size_margin()} returns the value of \eqn{N}.
  Note that in some cases it might not be possible to achieve the specified
  MOE for any finite sample size due to the ICC introducing too much
  variation, in which case this formula will return a negative value and the
  function will return an error.
  
  Although this is a very common approach, it has several weaknesses. First,
  notice that we sneakily replaced \eqn{\hat{p}} with \eqn{p} when moving to
  the sample size formula above. This implies that there is no uncertainty in
  our prevalence estimate, which is not true. Also note that the Wald
  interval assumes that the sampling distribution of our estimator is
  Gaussian, which is also not true. The difference between the Gaussian and
  the true distribution is particularly pronounced when prevalence is at the
  extremes of the range (near 0\% or 100\%). Here, the Wald interval can
  actually include values less than 0 or greater than 1, which are
  nonsensical.
  
  An arguably better approach is to construct CIs using the method of Clopper
  and Pearson (1934). This confidence interval guarantees that the false
  positive rate is \emph{at least} \eqn{alpha}, and in this sense is
  conservative. It can be asymmetric and does not suffer from the problem of
  allowing values outside the [0,1] range. To make the Clopper-Pearson
  interval apply to a multi-cluster survey, we can use the idea of effective
  sample size, \eqn{N_e}:
  
  \deqn{ D_{eff} = 1 + (N - 1)r }
  \deqn{ N_e = \frac{N}{D_{eff}} }
  
  We then calculate the Clopper-Pearson CI but using \eqn{N_e} in place of
  \eqn{N}. The function \code{get_margin_CP()} returns the expected lower and
  upper CI limits using the Clopper-Pearson interval, and the function
  \code{get_sample_size_margin_CP()} returns the corresponding sample size
  needed to achieve a certain MOE (the maximum of either lower or upper).

  A third option is to use the DRpower Bayesian model to estimate the
  credible interval of prevalence. See \code{?get_margin_Bayesian()} for how
  to do this.
